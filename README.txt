This is dumdumherd, an innovative new machine learning technique.
Instead of training one naive bayes classifier, dumdumherd trains a
herd of dumdums. Each dumdum is an extremely ignorant Naive Bayes
naive bayes classifier. Ignorant of course, meaning that it has only
seen two vectors of each class that it is trying to classify. 
dumdumherd is a painfully slow technique and shouldn't be used by
anyone, but is wildly amusing nonetheless.
